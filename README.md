# Hello!
This is my current collection of NixOS configuration files and a support script for building.

## configuration.nix
Sadly no flakes (I'm fine as is with channels for now, will see how long that lasts).
I pinky promise I will modularize it soon, I was just too special-interest-focusing on it to notice how long it has gotten

## hardware-configuration.nix
pretty much just the autogenerated stuff + my extra internal drive for media storage

## holy-mother-of-scripts.fish
This is the fun part you might want to look at. Install the dependencies in their recommended manners (either through packages or `programs.<package>.enable = true;`). Check the script itself or using `source holy-mother-of-scripts.fish -h` (intentionally long so you alias it to something funnier)
